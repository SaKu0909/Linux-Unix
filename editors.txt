Compare the three editors in these aspects:


Vim
- Learning curve: Vim is a good text editor tool. However, as a Window and Mac user, I found difficult to understand the logic of how commands were structured. Therefore, it was difficult
	for me to remember the commands by heart. In stead, I have a chart of most common commands while using Vim
- User interface: as mentioned before, there is no logic to me while learning Vim, so it's difficult to remember the commands. However, the commands seem to be simple, so practice will 
	most probably help
- Features: there are quite many features in Vim, that I have learnt from the learning materials. However, what I have noticed is that Vim can do so many things else, which requires user
	to discover while using it
- Speed: good enough for me
- Problems / issues with the editor: no
- Describe ideal use: in my opinion Vim is quite a good tool for simple text files


Emacs
- Learning curve: Emacs is a good text editor to start learning in Linux. As at the moment I am a Mac user, the command are differently from what are in the videos, so sometimes it was 
	slightly difficult to follow what is the command in Windows vs. Mac. However, once I understood the logic, it was easy to work with Emacs
- User interface: the commands' structure is not logical to me - a previous Window user and Mac nowadays. 
- Features: Emacs offers plenty of features which are useful in all different situation
- Speed: good enough for me
- Problems / issues with the editor: no
- Describe ideal use: in my opinion Emacs is rather good option for simple programming


micro
- Learning curve: I have learnt micro by watching Youtube video. I was surprise how easy to learn micro is, and for Window's users, micro is a great text editor tool, because same commands can be used both 
	in Window and micro. For example: Ctrl+C means copy, Ctrl+V means paste
- User interface: the commands are logical and similar to Windows, which is most used so it is easy to work with micro
- Features: I have learnt about basic features about micro, but I believe that there are so many more to learn, and I am excited to learn more about micro independently
- Speed: fast
- Problems / issues with the editor: no
- Describe ideal use: good option for programmin
